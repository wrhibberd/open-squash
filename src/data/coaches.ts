        bio: 'For those deep in the squash world, Amr needs no introduction. He won the World Junior Championship in 2010, both Individual and Teams. As a college player in the US, Amr won the US college national individual championship in 2014 (beating a young sophomore named Ali Farag) and won the prestigious Skillman Award for sportsmanship. He then went on to be top 50 PSA player with nine titles to his name – legendary Trinity coach Paul Assaiante has said Amr “has magical hands, moves like a cat and reads the game really well. But more important than Amr’s playing pedigree is the outstanding coaching career he has developed since. As an Egyptian National Junior Coach, he’s played an integral role in developing the current crop of top Egyptian juniors. He currently is squash director for the Maadi Club in Cairo, and is the founder of S Unit where he coaches elite juniors and PSA players such as Omar Mosaad (former PSA #3), Youssef Soliman (PSA #11) and Melissa Alves (PSA # 19). Amr’s years of living, playing and studying in the US give him the ability to translate the best of the Egyptian game to squash in the US, and we’re incredibly excited to have him bring his talents and expertise to our junior programs, primarily at FiDi but also at our other locations.'
